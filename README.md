# MultithreadedHybridQuicksort
Multithreaded and Hybrid Quicksort demonstration for EECS3540: Systems Programming.

This project showcases a multithreaded and hybrid quicksort algorithm for massive lists on a Linux system. The user has a choice between using Insertion or Shell sort past a user-set threshold instead of continuing with the quicksort, decreasing sort time.
